# Customer App Database Integration Guide

This document outlines how all customer app pages have been enhanced to connect with the Supabase database.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Overview

The customer app uses the following main tables:
- `customers` - Customer profiles and preferences
- `facilities` - Sports venues/facilities
- `courts` - Individual courts within facilities
- `bookings` - Customer bookings
- `time_slots` - Available time slots for booking
- `reviews` - Customer reviews and ratings
- `customer_favorites` - Customer favorite venues
- `notifications` - App notifications
- `facility_images` - Venue photos

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migrations
Execute these SQL files in your Supabase SQL Editor in order:

1. `schema.sql` - Main database schema
2. `customer_app_enhancements.sql` - Customer-specific tables
3. `complete_customer_app_setup.sql` - RLS policies and functions

### 2. Verify Supabase Configuration
Check `lib/customers/config/supabase_config.dart`:
- Ensure correct Supabase URL and anon key
- Update any regional settings if needed

### 3. Update Dependencies
The app requires these dependencies (already in pubspec.yaml):
```yaml
dependencies:
  supabase_flutter: ^2.5.6
  http: ^1.2.0
```
